# Black.GLFW3
GLFW wrapper that supports .NET 7 and Native AOT

## Notes
- The functions are written/tested as i use/need, so expect some bugs/errors or missing convenient methods on some functions.

- On Windows the **glfw3.dll** needs to be copied to the *output directory*. You can grab a pre-compiled binary on the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) site.

- This library is compatible **only** with GLFW **3.3.8**.

- For supported platforms see [.NET 7 Native AOT Platform Restrictions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net7#platformarchitecture-restrictions).
